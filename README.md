# RISC--V
PROCESSORS

A **processor** (CPU â€“ Central Processing Unit) is the **brain of a computer**, responsible for executing instructions, performing arithmetic and logical operations, and controlling the flow of data between memory and peripherals.

### **Key Components of a Processor**

1. **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)**

   * Performs **integer arithmetic** (add, sub, multiply, divide) and **logic operations** (AND, OR, XOR).

2. **FPU (Floating Point Unit)**

   * Handles **floating-point operations** like decimal calculations and scientific computations.

3. **Registers**

   * Small, fast storage locations inside the CPU for temporary data and instructions.

4. **Control Unit (CU)**

   * Directs the **flow of instructions and data** between ALU, memory, and I/O devices.

5. **Instruction Decoder**

   * Translates machine instructions into **control signals** for the ALU, FPU, memory, and other components.

6. **Cache (Optional)**

   * High-speed memory inside or near the CPU for **quick access to frequently used data**.

7. **Buses**

   * Electrical pathways that **transfer data, instructions, and addresses** between CPU, memory, and peripherals.

A processor (CPU) is the brain of a computer. It executes instructions, performs arithmetic & logic operations, handles floating-point calculations via the FPU, and controls data flow. Key components include ALU, FPU, registers, control unit, instruction decoder, cache, and buses.
