# RISC--V
#PROCESSORS

A **processor** (CPU ‚Äì Central Processing Unit) is the **brain of a computer**, responsible for executing instructions, performing arithmetic and logical operations, and controlling the flow of data between memory and peripherals.

### **Key Components of a Processor**

1. **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)**

   * Performs **integer arithmetic** (add, sub, multiply, divide) and **logic operations** (AND, OR, XOR).

2. **FPU (Floating Point Unit)**

   * Handles **floating-point operations** like decimal calculations and scientific computations.

3. **Registers**

   * Small, fast storage locations inside the CPU for temporary data and instructions.

4. **Control Unit (CU)**

   * Directs the **flow of instructions and data** between ALU, memory, and I/O devices.

5. **Instruction Decoder**

   * Translates machine instructions into **control signals** for the ALU, FPU, memory, and other components.

6. **Cache (Optional)**

   * High-speed memory inside or near the CPU for **quick access to frequently used data**.

7. **Buses**

   * Electrical pathways that **transfer data, instructions, and addresses** between CPU, memory, and peripherals.

A processor (CPU) is the brain of a computer. It executes instructions, performs arithmetic & logic operations, handles floating-point calculations via the FPU, and controls data flow. Key components include ALU, FPU, registers, control unit, instruction decoder, cache, and buses.

 # Instruction Execution Cycle

## 1. What is it?
The **Instruction Execution Cycle** (also called **Fetch‚ÄìDecode‚ÄìExecute Cycle**) is the **step-by-step process followed by the CPU to execute each instruction** in a program.  
It is a **repeating loop** that continues until the program ends.

---

## 2. Main Steps

### (a) **Fetch**
- CPU gets (fetches) the instruction from **memory (RAM)**.
- The **Program Counter (PC)** holds the address of the next instruction.
- Instruction is copied into the **Instruction Register (IR)**.
- **PC** is updated to point to the next instruction.

### (b) **Decode**
- CPU **decodes (interprets)** the instruction in the **IR**.
- The **Control Unit (CU)** figures out:
  - What operation to perform (**add, move, jump, etc.**).
  - Which **operands (data/addresses)** are needed.

### (c) **Execute**
- CPU carries out the instruction:
  - If it‚Äôs **arithmetic** ‚Üí **ALU** performs the operation.
  - If it‚Äôs **memory access** ‚Üí data is read/written.
  - If it‚Äôs a **jump/branch** ‚Üí **PC** is updated to a new address.

### (d) **Store (sometimes added)**
- Result of the operation is **stored back into memory or a register**.

## 3. Cycle Repeats
- After execution, the CPU goes back to **fetch the next instruction**.
- This cycle continues until the program ends.

[Fetch] ‚Üí [Decode] ‚Üí [Execute] ‚Üí [Store] ‚Üí (back to Fetch next instruction)

# Registers  :THE PROCESSOR'S WORKSPACE

## 1. **Definition**  
- **Registers** are **very small, very fast storage locations inside the CPU**.  
- They hold data, instructions, addresses, or control information temporarily **while the CPU is working**.  
- Think of them as the CPU‚Äôs **scratchpad** or **notepad** üìù.  

---

## 2. **Why are they needed?**  
- Accessing **RAM (memory)** is **slow** compared to CPU speed.  
- Registers are built **directly inside the processor chip**, so they can be accessed in **1 CPU clock cycle**.  
- This makes execution **much faster**.  

---

## 4. **Analogy**  
- Imagine you are solving math on paper:  
  - **Brain = CPU** üß†  
  - **Paper = RAM (memory)** üìÑ  
  - **Numbers you keep in your head = Registers**  

‚û°Ô∏è Registers are small but **super fast** ‚Üí that‚Äôs why the CPU loves to keep frequently used values there.

**Each flipflop stores 1 bit(0 or 1)
Together,32 flipflops=32 bit = 1 full register**

# RISC-V Registers Notes

## 1. x0
- In RISC-V, x0 is hardwired to 0  
  ‚Üí Means it always contains 0 ‚Äì you cannot overwrite it.  
  ‚Üí Any instruction that tries to write to x0 will be ignored.  

- It makes programming simpler & faster because CPU has a free zero constant available.  

### Common Use
- Clearing a register  
- Copying values  
- Comparisons  
- Creating NOP  

- Saves hardware complexity ‚Üí no need to load 0 from memory  
- Saves register space ‚Üí instead of unrolling/occupying a general register by storing 0 in it, dedicate the register that is always 0  
- Makes assembly code shorter & more efficient  
### Common Uses
```asm
add x5, x6, x0     # Copy value of x6 into x5
add x7, x0, x0     # Clear register (x7 = 0)
beq x3, x0, label  # Compare x3 with 0
```
## 2. x1 = ra (Return address register)
- When you call a function, CPU must remember where to come back once that function finishes.  
- It is a special address register that holds that return address.  

### Instruction: `jal` (Jump and Link)
- Used for function calls.  
- It does two things:  
  (a) Jumps to the function  
  (b) Stores the address of the next instruction (i.e. return address) into `ra (x1)`  

- So without the `ra` register, CPU wouldn‚Äôt know where to go back.  
- Every time a function is called, the return point is saved into `ra`.  

### Common Use
- Function calls  
- Nested calls  
  - `ra` stores return address, but if another function is called inside, the old one must be saved on stack, otherwise return path might be lost  

---

### Important
- If you overwrite `ra` accidentally ‚Üí program will jump to the wrong place = crash.  
- That is why compiler saves `ra` on stack if multiple nested calls are happening.  
  


## 3. x2 = sp (Stack pointer)
- It always points to the top of the stack in memory.  
- The stack is a special memory area used during function calls.  

### CPU uses stack to manage:
1. Local variables inside a function  
2. Return addresses  
3. Saved registers  

---

### How it works
- **When a function starts:**  
  - `sp` moves down (lower memory) to make space.  
  - Local variables and saved registers are stored there.  

- **When function ends:**  
  - Data is removed.  
  - `sp` moves back up to its old position.  

- Without stack pointer, CPU won‚Äôt know where local variables or `ra` are kept.  

- Helps in nested functions & recursion.  
- Keeps each function‚Äôs workspace separate.  

---

### Important
- `sp` must always be aligned properly (usually multiple of 16).  
- Compiler automatically uses `sp` when you work with functions.  
- If `sp` gets corrupted ‚Üí program crashes because CPU won‚Äôt find correct return address.  

---

### In short
`x2 (sp)` = CPU‚Äôs **bookmark for stack** ‚Üí it always points to the current top of the stack so that function calls, local variables & saved registers are managed safely.  
# RISC-V Registers Notes
# 4.x3=GP (Global Pointer)

- `gp` is a **special register** that points to the global data area in memory.
- Significantly, it points to the **middle of the static/global region**, so both directions (up/down) can be used for different kinds of data.

---

## Why `gp` is Useful

- Programs often need access to global variables, constants, arrays.
- Without `gp`, the CPU needs to **recalculate the address** of each global variable manually every time ‚Üí slower and more instructions.
- With `gp`, **globals can be accessed quickly with very small offsets**.

---

## Who Sets `gp`

- When a program starts, the **loader/OS sets `gp`** to point to the global data segment.

---

## Additional Notes

- You (the programmer) **rarely set `gp` yourself** ‚Äî the **compiler and OS handle it**.
- It makes code **position-independent**.
- Using `gp` makes accessing globals **faster**: offsets are **smaller and simpler**.

---

## Summary

- `x3 (gp)` ‚Üí CPU's **shortcut pointer** to the global/static variable area, so **global data can be accessed quickly with small offsets**.

## 5. x4 = tp (Thread pointer)
- It is a special register used in multi-threaded programs.  
- Each thread (like a mini-program running inside your program) needs its own private data area.  
- `tp` points to that thread‚Äôs local storage (TLS).  

---

### In modern programs (especially OS, servers, apps)
- Many threads run at the same time.  
- Each thread must keep:  
  - Its own stack  
  - Its own local/global variables  
  - Its own runtime data  

- Without `tp`, CPU wouldn‚Äôt know which thread‚Äôs data it is using ‚Üí chaos.  
- With `tp`, each thread can quickly access its private variables.  

---

### Important
- Normal single-threaded programs ‚Üí don‚Äôt use `tp`.  
- In OS kernels, multithreading libraries & browsers `tp` is essential.  
- Just like `gp` makes global data access fast, `tp` makes thread-local data access fast.  


## 6. x5 t0 (Temporary Register 0)

- `t0` is the first temporary register in RISC-V.
- Temporaries are **caller-saved registers** ‚Äî meaning if a function wants to keep their value safe, the caller must save them before calling another function.
- Basically, scratch space for quick calculations.
- The CPU needs scratch registers while doing arithmetic, logic, or intermediate steps.
- Instead of using memory (which is slower), CPUs use temporaries to hold temporary values.

### Example:

Suppose you want to calculate: `(a + b) * (c - d)`
1. Store `a + b` in `t0`
2. Store `c - d` in `t1`
3. Multiply them ‚Üí final result in `a0` (return register)

- If you call another function in between, you **must save `t0` somewhere** (usually on the stack), otherwise, it gets overwritten.

- `t0` (`x5`) **isn't preserved across function calls**.
- If you need long-term storage, use **saved registers**.
- Temporaries = fast & disposable work registers.
  - `x5 (t0)` = CPU's scratch register for temporary calculations.
  - Fast to use, but unsafe across function calls.

---

## 7. x6 t1 (Temporary Register 1)

- `t1` is the second temporary register in RISC-V.
- Belongs to the temporary / caller-saved group (`t0` to `t6`).
- Works just like `t0` (`x5`) ‚Äî used for quick, short-term storage during calculations.

### Why it exists:
- CPU often needs multiple scratch registers at once.

#### Example:

To calculate expression: `(a + b) * (c - d) + e * f`

- `t0`, `t1`, `t2` can each hold intermediate results **without wasting memory accesses**.

> `t1` = a temp. scratch register used for intermediate results in calculations, very fast but **not preserved across function calls**.

# RISC-V Register Notes

##  X7 ‚Üí `t2` (Temporary Register 2)

- `t2` is the **third temporary register** in RISC-V.
- Part of the **caller-saved temporaries** (`t0‚Äìt6`).
- Works like `t0 (x5)` and `t1 (x6)` ‚Üí used as a **scratch register** for quick calculations.

###  Why It Exists:
- Programs often need **more than 2 scratch values** at once.
- Avoids **frequent memory access**, which is slow.

###  How It Works:
- You store an intermediate result in `t2`.
- If you call another function in between, its value **might get overwritten** ‚Üí caller must **save it if needed**.
- It's **fast** but **not safe** across function calls.

###  Usage:
- `t2` is the **last of the**
-  just like t0,t1 t is caller saved
-  Best used when you need multiplee intermediate  results in one calculations (but not preservedacross function calls)


## 9.X8 ‚Üí s0 / fp (Saved Register 0 / Frame Pointer)

### Dual Role

1. **s0 (Saved Register 0)**  
   - Used as a long-term variable storage across functions.

2. **fp (Frame Pointer)**  
   - Used to mark the base of the current function's stack frame.

### Why it exists

#### As `s0` (Saved Register)
- Some variables must stay alive across function calls.
- If you keep them in temporary registers, they will be lost.
- Saved registers like `s0` are callee-saved ‚Äî the function you call must restore them before returning.

#### As `fp` (Frame Pointer)
- In functions, local variables are placed in the stack.
- As the stack grows up and down, addresses change.
- `fp` stays fixed at one base of the function's stack frame, especially useful to access variables reliably.
- Important for nested functions and debugging, where stack pointer (`sp`) keeps changing.

### How it works
- When a function starts:
  - The old `fp` is saved onto the stack.
  - The new `fp` is set to the current stack pointer (`sp`).
  - Local variables are accessed using fixed offsets from `fp`.
- When the function ends:
  - Restore the old `fp`.
  - Free the stack.

### Usage
- `s0` acts like any saved register (safe across calls).
- `fp` gives a stable reference point inside the stack frame.
- Not all programs use `fp`, b
### 10.X9 ‚Üí s1 (Saved Register 1)

- s1 is a saved register  
- Used to store variables that must be preserved across function calls  
- Values in s1 remain unchanged even if function calls happen  
- Useful for keeping data safe when calling other functions  

#### Why it exists:
- When a function calls another function, some registers can get overwritten  
- To avoid losing important values, s1 saves these values  
- This helps in maintaining consistent program state  

#### How it works:
- Before calling a function, current function saves important values in s1  
- Called function can freely use temporary registers without affecting s1  
- After the call, the original function restores values from s1  

#### Imp:
- s1 must be preserved across function calls  
- If a function uses s1, it must save and restore its value properly  
- s1 helps in keeping local variables intact between calls


### 11.X10 ‚Üí a0 (Argument Register / Return value 0)

- a0 is first argument register  
- It is also the return value register  
- Dual purpose: input (function's first parameter) and output (function's result)

#### Why it exists:
- To avoid slow memory access when passing function inputs/outputs  
- CPU/compiler knows exactly where to look for the first input & where to find the return value  
- This makes function call very fast and consistent

#### How it works:
- When a function is called  
  ‚Üí The first input goes into a0  
- Inside the function  
  ‚Üí Calculations may overwrite a0  
- When returning  
  ‚Üí The final result is placed in a0

#### Imp:
- If function returns 1 value ‚Üí always in a0  
- If function returns 2 values ‚Üí a0 = first result, a1 = second result  
- Every function
### 12.X11 ‚Üí a1 (Argument / Return Register 1)

- a1 is the second argument register  
- Also works as the second return value register (if a function returns two values)

#### Why it exists:
- Most functions need more than one input  
- Instead of getting inputs from memory, RISC-V uses fast registers  
- That‚Äôs why a1 is fixed for the second input parameter  
- If the function has multiple outputs, a1 can also carry the second output

#### How it works:
- When function is called  
  ‚Üí a0 gets first argument  
  ‚Üí a1 gets the second argument  
- When returning multiple values  
  ‚Üí a0 ‚Üí first result  
  ‚Üí a1 ‚Üí second result

#### Imp:
- It always holds the second function argument  
- Can also hold the second return value (if needed)  
- Together with a0, a1 is one of the most important registers in function calls

---

### 13.X12 ‚Üí a2 (Argument Register 2)

- a2 is the third argument register  
- Used to hold the third input parameter of a function

#### Why it exists:
- Most real world functions need more than two inputs  
- Instead of sending inputs via memory, CPU uses fast registers  
- That‚Äôs why a2 is fixed for the third input parameter

#### How it works:
- When function is called:  
  ‚Üí a0 = first argument  
  ‚Üí a1 = second argument  
  ‚Üí a2 = third argument  
- Inside the function, a2 can be used directly for calculations  
- On return: a0 (and a1 if needed) carry the outputs ‚Üí a2 isn‚Äôt used for return

#### Imp:
- a2 is only for input arguments, never used as return  
- Together with a0‚Äìa7, it allows up to 8 arguments to be passed via registers  
- If function has more than 8 inputs ‚Üí extra ones are passed via memory/stack

---

### 14.X13 ‚Üí a3 (Argument Register 3)

- a3 is the fourth argument register  
- It holds the fourth input parameter of a function during a call

#### Why it exists:
- Many functions need 4 or more inputs (like math operations, physics formulas, graphics)  
- To keep things fast, RISC-V assigns fixed registers (a0‚Äìa7) for the first 8 inputs  
- a3 is specifically reserved for the fourth input

#### How it works:
- On a function call  
  ‚Üí a0 = 1st  
  ‚Üí a1 = 2nd  
  ‚Üí a2 = 3rd  
  ‚Üí a3 = 4th  
- Inside the function, a3 is used directly for calculations  
- On return: a3 isn‚Äôt used for results

---

### 15.X14 ‚Üí a4 (Argument Register 4)

- a4 is the fifth argument register  
- Used to hold the fifth input parameter during function call

#### Why it exists:
- Many functions require more than four parameters  
- a4 provi


# 5MEMORY SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

The term ‚ÄúMemory System Architecture‚Äù refers to the design and organization of a computer‚Äôs memory system, including how memory is structured, accessed, and managed to store and retrieve data efficiently. It‚Äôs a key part of computer architecture because memory speed and organization directly affect a processor‚Äôs performance

1. Components of a Memory System Architecture

A memory system is usually hierarchical, with different levels of memory differing in speed, size, and cost:

Registers

Fastest memory inside the CPU.

Very small in size.

Used for immediate operations.

Cache Memory

Small but faster memory located close to the CPU.

Stores frequently used data.

Levels: L1 (fastest, smallest), L2 (slightly bigger), L3 (largest, slower).

Main Memory (RAM)

Larger than cache but slower.

Stores programs and data currently in use.

Secondary Storage

Hard disk drives (HDD), SSDs.

Very large but slow.

Used for long-term storage.

Tertiary/Off-line Storage

Optical disks, tapes, cloud storage.

Extremely large and slow.

Used for backup/archive.

2. Key Concepts in Memory System Architecture

Memory Hierarchy: Organizes memory from fastest/smallest to slowest/largest. Goal: maximize speed and minimize cost.

Access Time: Time it takes to read/write data.

Bandwidth: Amount of data that can be read/written per unit time.

Latency: Delay between requesting data and receiving it.

Volatility: Whether memory retains data without power (RAM is volatile, SSD/HDD is non-volatile).

3. How It Works Together

The CPU first checks registers ‚Üí then cache ‚Üí then main memory ‚Üí then secondary storage if data isn‚Äôt found.

Techniques like caching, paging, and virtual memory help manage data efficiently across this hierarchy.
